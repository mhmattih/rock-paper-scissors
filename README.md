# rock-paper-scissors
This is my first game project using Javascript! 
The purpose was to create a classic rock paper scissors game with some sort of scoreboard and game result log.

Required skills for this project:
- HTML, Javascript, Flexbox, 
- GIT, GitHub, Use of linux terminal, Visual Studio Code
- A lot of Googling on different topics 

Game specs
- Five wins to victory!
- How game works
    - Game starts by selecting either Rock, Paper or Scissors. Selection is then highlighted. 
    - After this computer make its turn and round is completed. 
    - Result of a single game is shown to user.
    - When either has 5 wins, match is stopped and Winner is showed on the page. 
    - To play another game button arrives and new match can be started.
